what is a layout inflater? 
  takes xml and converts it into a java object
very time consuming operation
  keep in mind this is an expensive operation
  must also recursively go through all the child views and set values and attributes
  
  
 there are 2 ways to get the layout inflater
 
 1. from the content, use getSystemService() or, 
 2. getLayoutInflater()
 
 How does it work 
 
 Layout inflater l = getLayoutInflater() 
 
 View v = l.inflater(int resource, ViewGroup parent) 
 
 @param resource: 
 @param parent: 
  parent is optional 
  
 what is v?  the root view representing the resource
 
 if your xml only contains a TextView, then v will be the TextView
 if your xml contains a LinearLayout with a TextView inside the the LinearLayout, then v will be the LinearLayout
 
 example 
 
 View v = l.inflater(R.layout.sublayout, null)
 
 at this point,
 v contains | the TextView sublayout
 parent of v | null
 layout params of v | null
 
 inflating a view with a parent
 
 View v = l.inflate(R.layout.sublayout, linear) 
 
 v contains | reference to the LinearLayout we used as parent
 parent of v | parent of LinearLayout
 LayoutParams | inherits the params of the root view of the LinearLayout
 
 The 3rd parameter
 
 View v = l.inflate(R.layout.sublayout, linear, true)
 
 what's the 3rd parameter??? 
 
 true is a 3rd parameter called attachToRoot which means
 R.layout.sublayout should be inflated and made part of the 
 parent linear
 
 same as l.inflate(R.layout.sublayout, linear) 
 
v contains |  reference to the LinearLayout we used as parent
parent of v | parent of LinearLayout
Layout para 
 
What if you use false as the 3rd parameter? 

this is the case where we want a reference to the view we're attaching

View v = l.inflate(R.layout.sublayout,  linear, false)

v contains | TextView
parent of v | null
layout params | LinearLayout
